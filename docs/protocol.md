# Serial protocol implemented by the firmware

Source of truth for tty2oled behaviour: `MiSTer_SSD1322_USB.ino` (BuildVersion 230702) and
`tty2oled.sh` at venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled `50c08ac`. Details and evidence: `docs/research.md`.
Implementation: `firmware/lib/protocol/` (pure C++, unit-tested with `pio test -e native`).

## Link

USB CDC-ACM (ESP32-S3 USB Serial/JTAG, 303a:1001). Baud rate and line settings are ignored.
The host should set the port raw (`stty ... raw -echo -hupcl`), like tty2oled does.

## Framing

- **Text line**: bytes up to `\n`. A trailing `\r` is removed. Empty lines are ignored.
  Like `Serial.readStringUntil('\n')` with a 500 ms timeout, an unterminated line is also accepted
  after 500 ms without new bytes.
- Lines longer than 255 bytes are dropped up to the next `\n`. Lines with control bytes (< 0x20,
  0x7F) are dropped: they are almost always the tail of a picture cut by a timeout.
- **Picture**: after a line starting with `CMDCOR` or `CMDAPD`, the next bytes are a raw picture
  with **no length header**:
  - 2048 bytes = XBM, 256×64, 1 bpp, 32 bytes/row, least significant bit = leftmost pixel;
  - 8192 bytes = GSC, 256×64, 4 bpp, 128 bytes/row, high nibble = left pixel, 0 black .. 15 white.

  The picture ends at 8192 bytes, or after 500 ms without a byte (then 2048 = XBM, anything else
  = error). If no byte arrives within 1 s of the command line, the picture is "missing".
  tty2oled.sh sleeps 0.2 s between the line and the data.
- Limitation inherited from tty2oled: a command sent less than 500 ms after an XBM picture is read
  as picture data (the result is then an error and the name is shown). tty2oled.sh never does this.

## Replies

- `ttyack;` (no newline) after every line and every picture. `CMDSTTYACK,0` turns it off.
- No `ttyrdy;` at boot (the sketch sends one; nothing reads it, and over USB it would sit in front
  of the next reply).
- Replies the host does not read within 300 ms are dropped, except up to 64 bytes already in the
  USB FIFO (in practice one `ttyack;`). Before a query, send `CMDNULL` and discard what comes back.

## tty2oled commands

| Command | Behaviour here |
|---|---|
| `<core name>` (any other line) | Show the core name (text screen) |
| `CMDCOR,<core>[,t]` + picture | Show the picture scaled to 320×80 (area-averaged), centered, no text; on a missing/bad picture show the name. `t` is accepted and ignored (no transitions yet) |
| `CMDAPD,<core>` + picture | Store the picture and name, do not draw |
| `CMDSPIC[,t]` | Show the stored core screen |
| `CMDSNAM` | Show the name screen |
| `CMDCLS`, `cls` | Clear the screen |
| `CMDCLSWU` | Clear the frame buffer, do not update the screen |
| `CMDDUPD` | Update the screen from the frame buffer |
| `CMDCLST,t,c` | Fill with grey level `c`, forget the stored picture |
| `CMDDOFF` / `CMDDON` | Backlight and panel off / on (content kept) |
| `CMDCON,<0..255>` | Brightness: maps to backlight 40..255 (0 is dim, not black) |
| `CMDROT,<0\|1>` | 1 = turned 180° |
| `CMDTXT,f,c,b,x,y,text` | Text in a 256×64 area centered on the screen; fonts mapped to similar ones; `f >= 100` = buffer only |
| `CMDGEO,g,c,x,y,i,j,k,l` | Figures 1..10 in the same 256×64 area; `g >= 100` = buffer only |
| `CMDSORG`, `sorg` | Start screen |
| `CMDTEST` | Colour bars, 16 greys, 1 px red frame |
| `CMDHWINF` | `HWTDISPS3;MDS-<version>;\n` |
| `CMDRESET` | Restart after 100 ms (the USB port stays; no re-enumeration) |
| `CMDSETTIME,<epoch>` | Sets the clock (tty2oled sends local time as an epoch). Used by the menu and idle clock screens |
| `QWERTZ` (also with leading noise), `CMDNULL`, `CMDSAVER`, `CMDSWSAVER`, `CMDSECD`, `CMDSHCD`, `CMDSHTIME`, `CMDSSCP`, `CMDBYE`, `bye` | Accepted, nothing visible yet |
| any other `CMD...` | Ignored (the sketch would draw it as a core name) |

`HWTDISPS3` is 9 characters, as `installer.sh` expects (`${BLA:0:9}`), and unknown to its flasher.
The version starts with a letter, so the installer sees it as newer than any tty2oled build and does
not offer an update.

## Colour pictures: `MDSIMG`

```
MDSIMG,<bytes>,<crc32>,<png|jpg>,<core>\n
<bytes> raw bytes of the file
```

- `<bytes>`: file length, 1..524288 (512 KB, the PSRAM buffer). A larger or unreadable value is a
  broken header: nothing is skipped, and the following bytes are dropped as non-printable lines.
- `<crc32>`: 8 hex digits, CRC-32 as computed by zlib / `python3 -c "import zlib; ..."`.
- `<png|jpg>`: PNG (any bit depth, palette, alpha, interlaced; alpha is blended on black) or
  **baseline** JPEG (progressive JPEG is not supported by the decoder).
- `<core>`: the core name, shown as text if the picture cannot be used.
- The picture is drawn centered on black at 1:1. `tools/convert_asset.py` makes 320×170 files.
- Unlike `CMDCOR`, the length is announced: the frame ends exactly after `<bytes>`, and a command may
  follow immediately. If the sender stops for 1 s before the end, the frame is `incomplete`.
- Reply: `MDSIMG;ok\n` or `MDSIMG;err=<header|size|incomplete|crc|format|decode>\n`, then `ttyack;`.
  On an error the core name is shown.
- Measured on the board (USB from a Mac): 9.5 KB JPEG 0.07 s, 16 KB PNG 0.08 s, 137 KB PNG 0.30 s,
  transfer and decoding included.

## MiSTerLily commands (prefix `MDS`, unused by tty2oled)

| Command | Reply |
|---|---|
| `MDSPING` | `MDSPONG;up=<uptime ms>\n`. Our daemon sends it every 5 s: a lower uptime means the board restarted (resend everything); once pings were seen, 15 s without one shows "Waiting for MiSTer". Pings do not wake an idle-sleeping screen |
| `MDSCFG` | `MDSCFG;contrast=<0..255>;rotate=<0\|1>;idle=<minutes>;fade=<0\|1>;idleclock=<0\|1>\n` (settings stored in flash) |
| `MDSCFG,idle,<minutes>` | Backlight off after `<minutes>` without a core change or display command (0 = never, the default; max 1440); replies like `MDSCFG` |
| `MDSCFG,fade,<0\|1>` | Short backlight dip on core changes (default 1). `CMDCOR,<core>,0` skips it for one change |
| `MDSCFG,idleclock,<0\|1>` | When idle: a dim clock instead of a dark screen (default 0; needs the time) |
| `MDSCFG,reset` | Default settings (brightness 200, no rotation, no idle sleep, fade on, no idle clock) |
| `MDSLOGO` | `MDSLOGO;crc=<hex>;bytes=<n>;format=<png\|jpg>\n` or `MDSLOGO;none\n`: the stored start-up picture |
| `MDSLOGO,<bytes>,<crc32>,<png\|jpg>` + file | Store the start-up picture in flash (same framing as `MDSIMG`, max 256 KB). Reply `MDSLOGO;ok\n` or `MDSLOGO;err=<header\|size\|incomplete\|crc\|format\|storage>\n` |
| `MDSCFG,logo,0` | Delete the stored start-up picture (back to the text start screen) |
| `MDSNET,<ip>` | The MiSTer's IP address, shown on the menu clock screen (empty = none) |
| `MDSINFO` | `MDSINFO;fw=..;board=T-Display-S3;psram=..;fb=psram;uptime_ms=..;reset=..;lines=..;images=..;discards=..;txdrop=..;txstale=..;lastimg=<result>:<bytes>;core=..\n` |
| `MDSCORE,<core>` | Show the core name (no picture transfer) |
| `MDSSHOT` | `MDSSHOT,<w>,<h>,<bytes>\n`, then `ttyack;`, then the frame buffer (RGB565 big-endian, row-major). `tools/screenshot.py` saves it as PNG |

`lastimg` result: 0 = ok, 1 = no data, 2 = bad length. `asseterr`: last `MDSIMG` error or `none`.
`host`: `none` (no ping seen, e.g. stock tty2oled daemon), `ok` or `lost`. `idle`: `awake` or `sleep`.
`reset`: ESP-IDF reset reason (1 power-on, 3 software/`CMDRESET`, 6 task watchdog, ...).

`MDSHANG` exists only in the `tdisplay_s3_debug` build: it stops the main loop to check the watchdog.

## Device behaviour

- **Settings**: `CMDCON` (brightness) and `CMDROT` (rotation) are stored in flash, written only when
  they change, and applied before the first frame after boot. `CMDSTTYACK` is not stored.
- **Watchdog**: if the main loop stops for 8 s the board restarts. The USB port stays (no
  re-enumeration); the ROM boot text appears on the port. Our daemon notices the restart through
  `MDSPONG` and sends the core again. With the stock tty2oled daemon the start screen stays until
  the next core change (as with tty2oled's own hardware).
- **Idle sleep**: off by default (an LCD has no burn-in). `CMDDOFF`/`CMDDON` stay independent: a core
  change wakes an idle sleep, but not a `CMDDOFF`.
- **Start screen**: the stored start-up picture (centered in the top 320×130 area; text "MiSTer /
  T-Display-S3" if there is none or it cannot be decoded), the firmware version bottom right, and
  after 10 s without any data "Waiting for MiSTer" below the picture. The picture lives in LittleFS
  on the `spiffs` data partition, which firmware uploads do not touch.
- **Menu screen**: a core named `MENU` without a picture shows time, date and the IP from `MDSNET`
  (once the time is known), redrawn every minute.
- **Fade**: the backlight goes down (120 ms), the new frame is pushed, and it comes back (180 ms).
  The main loop keeps running during the fade.
